Woodmont Civic Association Newsletter

May 2023

Dear Woodmont Residents,

We are excited to announce that our newsletter is going digital! With this move, we hope to provide more timely updates and information to our community. Don't worry, if you prefer a physical copy, you can still print out the newsletter from our website.

As we move forward, we want to keep you informed about the changes happening in our community. Recently, we have been discussing plans to remove the magnolia trees from the entrance that are outgrowing their space. We will be consulting with a landscape architect and replacing them with shrubs more suitable for the space. We believe that this will not only improve the aesthetics of our entrance but also ensure the safety of our residents.

In addition to this, we are also re-evaluating some of the longstanding charter items in the association covenant. As a community, we want to make sure that our rules and regulations are relevant to our current needs and goals. We encourage all residents to share their feedback and suggestions regarding this matter.

We appreciate your continued support and participation in the Woodmont Civic Association. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please don't hesitate to contact us. We look forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,

Zepterfd

President, Woodmont Civic Association
